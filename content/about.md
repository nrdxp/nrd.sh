I'm Tim DeHerrera (nrdxp), an engineer at [IOG](https://iog.io) where I develop interoperable blockchain infrastructure for the Cardano ecosystem.

As co-founder of the [Ekala Project](https://github.com/ekala-project), I'm building next-generation tooling for reproducible builds and declarative systems.

With a decade of experience in distributed systems, build infrastructure, and network optimization, I craft tools that emphasize reproducibility and determinism. My engineering approach leverages expressive type systems and functional programming paradigms, with current focus on the Rust and Nix ecosystems.

If you're interested in working together or supporting my open source contributions, consider [hiring](/hire) me or reaching out through any of the social links above. I'm always happy to chat!
